We had an opportunity to access data which was collected by Aalto university's research group lead by Jukka Manner and our assignment was to invent and implement some kind of service utilizing this data.

This data is collected with Netradar mobile application, which makes measurements reagarding to users network.
What we decided to implement was a service for private customers who want to know, which mobile  operator works best in their area. The area is given as postal code and our service uses algorithm to give points to different operators according to measurements made in that area. 

Our other service allows its users to get more specific information about some areas network coverage or how different mobile operators compare. This service can draw graphs to display data in a user friendly and informative way.
